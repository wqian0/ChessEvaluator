# ChessEvaluator

A neural network that predicts the most likely outcome of a chess game (white wins, draw, black wins) from a given starting position, based on the two players' chess ratings. This network was trained on over 50 million positions drawn from human games found in the [lichess game database](https://database.lichess.org/).
